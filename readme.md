This code is the full scene for Project 1: 3D Shaders, done by Matthew Merritt and Michael Merritt. 

## Running the Scene

Ensure that you have the following python packages installed:

```
numpy==2.2.2
pillow==11.1.0
pygame==2.6.1
PyOpenGL==3.1.9
```

Once the packages are installed, run the following:
